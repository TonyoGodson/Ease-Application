# Ease App

## Overview
Ease App is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to provide users with a seamless authentication experience. It includes features such as user registration, login, password recovery via OTP, and a "Remember Me" option for persistent authentication. The app leverages **Provider** for state management and uses **SharedPreferences** for local storage.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter** (Version 3.27.3)
- **Provider** (State Management)
- **SharedPreferences** (Local Storage for Remember Me feature)

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Sign-up, Login, and Forgot Password functionalities.
